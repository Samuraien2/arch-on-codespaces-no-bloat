# Future Plans for Arch-on-Codespaces (and Beyond!)

We're excited about the future of running Arch Linux—and other headless Linux distros—on GitHub Codespaces. Here's what's on our roadmap:

---

## Planned Features

- **Web-based Terminal Mode:**  
  Launch a full-featured, interactive terminal right in your browser, no need for SSH or local CLI tools.

- **Distro Selector:**  
  Use a single repository to choose from multiple Linux distributions when creating your Codespace—Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, and more!

- **Additional Improvements:**  
  Stay tuned for more features, enhancements, and community-driven ideas.
